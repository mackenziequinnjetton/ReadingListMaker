This program allows users to query the Google Books API for books by title, select a book from the 5 displayed, and add it to a reading list. The user can also view their reading list.

Please note that at the time of this writing, the reading list does not persist between sessions. Note also that the program is structured such that it reads the Google API key from a .txt file outside the repository. To make this program run properly, you will need to paste your API key into a .txt file with no other contents, save it to a location on your computer, and change the path on the first line of the BookSearchHelper function to point to the location of your API key file.
